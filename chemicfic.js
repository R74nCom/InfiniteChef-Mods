# How to Create a Mod

See [example_mod.js](https://github.com/R74nCom/InfiniteChef-Mods/tree/main/example_mod.js) to learn the basics of modding.

To test your mod, you can usually copy-paste the entire script into your browser's console. Usually this is done by pressing F12 and going to the 'Console' tab.
